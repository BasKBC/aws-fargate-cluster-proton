Mappings:
  # The VPC and subnet configuration is passed in via the environment spec.
  SubnetConfig:
    VPC:
      CIDR: Fn::GetAtt:['{{ environment.inputs.vpc_to_be_used}}', CidrBlock]

    PublicTwo:
      CIDR: '{{ environment.inputs.subnet_two_cidr}}'
Resources:
  # Setup networking resources for the public subnets. Containers
  # in the public subnets have public IP addresses and the routing table
  # sends network traffic via the internet gateway.
